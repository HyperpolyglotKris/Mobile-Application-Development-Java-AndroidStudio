I have a background in linguistics and speak multiple modern languages such as: English, French ,German, Spanish, Russian, Bulgarian, as well as a little bit of Mandarin and Japanese. Apart from that, I am also a volleyball athlete and a self-taught piano player. I have always been interested in computers and technology, which is why I want to work in this domain.
